# Flask-Market
An e-commerce site built with Flask and based off of the Jim Shaped Coding Tutorial available via freedcodecamp.com. The site has a list of items for sale that you a user can buy and is also suited with a login and authentication system. The styling is provided by Bootstrap5. The authentication system uses Werkzeug and the database uses SQLAlchemy as an ORM. Both were quite easy to use and were a huge help in creating a secure and updateable site.  I made some adjustments on my own to personalize the site and had to modify some of the code, particularly bootstrap classes, to match current formats. I had been struggling to learn the ins and outs of Flask for some time and felt that following a tutorial as extensive as this was a huge help in seeing out a project to completion. I gained really valuable experience and was able to make a better judgement about Flask as a web framework as a result. I found the database creation and modification was extremely intuitive and easy while the login and authentication systems were quite difficult to complete, as there is no single module in Flask capable of fulfilling both roles. Regarding the front-end, the Jinja2 template system is quite intuitive and therefore easy to work with. Having worked with JavaScript's React library, the Python web frameworks do not afford the degree of interactivity of their JS counterparts and are therefore best used for back-end development.
